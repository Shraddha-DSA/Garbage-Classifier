# Garbage Classifier

**Garbage Classifier** is an AI-powered project that classifies waste into different categories and provides proper disposal guidance along with environmental impact information. This project is implemented using **Keras** with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## Features

- Classifies waste into **four categories**:
  - Biodegradable
  - Recyclable
  - Hazardous
  - General
- Provides **disposal instructions** for each category.
- Shows **environmental impact** for proper waste management.
- Easy to test with any image of waste.
